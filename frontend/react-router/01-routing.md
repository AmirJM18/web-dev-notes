# Single-Page Apps
SPAs

Web apps that display on a single web page
html,css and js are loaded only once by the browser
and content changes dynamically as the user interacts with the app

the app never reloads unless the user manually refreshes it
similar UX to mobile and desktop applications

## SPA routing
responsible for loading and unloading content while matching the URL with a set of components being rendered

should also keep track of browser history
so users can navigate app using browsers back and forward buttons
if user shares or bookmarks an app, the URL should always direct the user to the correct location

SPAs with routing should mimic regular user experience with multi-page web pages

or they have usability problems
broken urls

JavaScript frameworks like angular and ember come with built in routing features

but React is not a framework
it is only a library concerned with rendering your UI
so they React community built the React Router - the official react library

how does react router fit into reacts declarative and modular style of building user interfaces and why it is the most reliable routing solution for react
