Looks like bower was what was used to install it and now npm can install it.

`$ npm i Polymer npm-polymer-elements --save-dev`



## Install the Polymer CLI

1. Install the LTS version (4.x) of Node.js. The current version (6.x) should work, but is not officially supported. Versions below LTS are not supported.

2. Install the Polymer CLI

`$ npm install -g polymer-cli`

## Initialize your project from a template

1. Create a new project folder to start from

```
 $ mkdir my-app
 $ cd my-app
```

2. Initialize your project with an app template

`$ polymer init starter-kit`
