# Modern React with Redux
![diagram](Documents/dev/web-dev-notes/frontend/udemy/modern-react-with-redux)

Start nice and easy

No browser has complete support for ES6
React and Redux are written in ES6

## Transpiling
We can't use the code as it won't render properly in browser
We need to take our ES6 code that can't be run in the browser and transpile it into something that can be read in the browser

## Tooling (Transpile JSX + ES6 to ES5)
Webpack + babel create bundle.js which is all of our code, transpiled into JavaScript that can be safely run inside of a browser
