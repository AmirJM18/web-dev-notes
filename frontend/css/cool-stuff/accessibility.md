# Making Apps accessible
1. Have well-organized code that uses appropriate markup
2. Ensure text alternatives exist for non-text and visual content
3. Create easily-navigatible pages that are keyboard-friendly

[W3 Consortium's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php)
They set the international standard for accessibility and provide a number of criteria you can use to check your work.
