# Conceptual Aside
## APIs and Endpoints

## API
* A Set of tools for building a software application
    - Usually other software that is made available to us to help us build software
* Stands for `Application Programming Interface`
        - On the web the tools are usually made available via a <u>set of **URLs**</u> which accept and send only data via `HTTP` and `TCP/IP`
        - In other words, a URL that you go to that instead of returning an Application it gives you back data
        - And you can send data (an HTTP request) to that URL and the API will do something with that data
        - The URL itself is called and **Endpoint**

## Endpoint
* One URL in a Web API
* Sometimes that endpoint (URL) does multiple things by making choices based on the HTTP request headers
* They give and receive data in a particular format
    - The most popular format today for data exchange is JSON
