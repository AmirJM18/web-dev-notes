# Modules
* A reusable block of code whose existence does not accidentally impact other code
* JavaScript didn't have the before
    - New feature in ES6
    - Lots of programming languages have this feature
* Before Node.js, JavaScript had a workaround to protect your code but it wasn't officially supported of the spec langauge
* Node.js needed to give us the ability to build modules
    - resuable blocks of code where I could put code into that block and it would not affect other blocks of code in the rest of my Application unintentionally

## CommonJS Modules
* An agreed upon standard for how code modules should be structured
