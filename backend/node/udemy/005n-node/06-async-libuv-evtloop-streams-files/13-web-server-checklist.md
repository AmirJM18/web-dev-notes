# Web Server Checklist

* We can reuse our code in better ways through modules
* NodeJS provides modules
* Now ES6 modules are here and part of the JavaScript Engine
* We also have ways to deal with files
    - Node has provided async and sync abilities to pull binary data into a buffer so that we can work with it
* We also have ways to deal with work that takes a long time
    - We can keep our code running in the V8 JavaScript Engine while other things are synchronously happening in Node or the OS and the Event Loops helps us know when that happens and when V8 is done working it will execute the callback that we ask it to
    - We've seen Streams that break up large amounts of data into chunks
