# The Mean Stack
* `M`ongoDB
    - Stores your data in documents that look a lot like JSON and JavaScript object literal notation
* `E`xpress
    - JavaScript framework that makes things like routing, writing APIs, and working with HTTP easier
* `A`ngularJS
    - JavaScript framework for managing code and UI in the browser, removing a lot of manual work
* `N`odeJS
    - JavaScript on the server
    - Handle HTTP requests and responses and lots more

These 4 technologies all have JavaScript in common and that is why they naturally work very well together

## The Order
* The name MEAN was used to spell MEAN but the real order should be:
    - bottom - MongoDB --- where your data sits
    - then NodeJS on top of mongo -- getting and sending the data to the Database
    - then Express on top of NodeJS which makes it easier to build the APIs
    - Then Angular at the top which is getting and receiving that data
    - But MNEA isn't a cool acronym, MEAN sounds better :)

## Stack
* The comgination of all technologies used to build a piece of software
* Your database system
* Your server side code
* Your client side code
* And everything else

### Why called stack?
* One builds on the other
* They all work together
