# Conceptual Aside
* Angular 1
* Angular 2
* React
* Backbone
* Ember
* Vues
* And More...

## Angular and React
* Just JavaScript that is running in the browser
* The HTML is converted into the DOM
* The DOM is a tree-like structure in memory
* There is JavaScript running inside the JavaScript Engine (embedded in the browser) that can manipulate the DOM

### Important to remember - It's all just JavaScript!
* They are not adding anthing to the JavaScript Engine
* They are not adding anything to the browser
* They are just using what JavaScript and the JavaScript Engine make available to the browser
* Node is JavaScript but it's built upon C++
* All the above are just JavaScript
