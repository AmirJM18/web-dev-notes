* The way of adding features
* Build the base to make Node.js a Web Server

## The Node repo
[node repo](https://github.com/nodejs/node)

The C++ core
* core of features/utilities built in C++ and made available to JavaScript via the hooks in the V8 engine

## Mental Model
Node.js is not JavaScript but it accepts JavaScript and allows us to have more features that we write with it than normal
