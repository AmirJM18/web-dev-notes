# Environmental Variables
We are building our project on Express

## What is Express?
Fast, unopinionated minimalist web framework for Node.js

* Unoninionated and minimalist
    + Doesn't do much by itself
    + So we pick and choose pieces of the node echosystem we want to use in order to make things work
    + Nothing comes `batteries included`

* Express Session will manage sessions
* We'll use Mongoose to work with MongoDB database
    - Mongoose is a nice interface for MongoDB

## app.js
* Lots of stuff inside here
* We'll learn about everything in this file as we build our app

## What does `start.js` do?
* imports `mongoose` - we use this to interface with our mongodb
* if check -> make sure we are on node 7.6+ (totally optional can delete if you want)

## Environmental Variables
* This is where you store your sensitive information
* passwords, usernames, logins, API keys, tokens
* anything you need to keep safe

### variables.env
Q: Why don't we just keep this in a `.txt` file?
A: This info should NEVER go into your Git repo because this info is based on the environment you are on

* You will also have a `variables.env` file on your server
    - It might be named production, your Database will be different
    - Your mail server will be different
    - API keys

### The `dotenv` package
Takes all stuff inside `variables.env` and allow us to access it via `process.env.NAMEOFVARIABLEWENEED`

* Should be named `variables.env`

### mongodb instance connection info
We don't want to use this:

`mongoose.connect('mongodb:...')`

Because that will change depending on our environment so we use this instead:

`mongoose.connect(process.env.DATABASE);`

And if you open `variables.env` you'll see our DATABASE variable which will look something like:

`DATABASE=
mongodb://coolguy:abceasyas123@ohyeah.mlab.com:0u812/awesome`

### We use ES6 Promises in Mongoose
(You could use External Libraries like [bluebird](http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/getting-started.html))

But we will use the built-in ones so we can use async-await so that is why we need `mongoose.Promise = global.Promise;`

Show errors when we have them

```
mongoose.connection.on('error', (err) => {
  console.error(`ðŸ™… ðŸš« ðŸ™… ðŸš« ðŸ™… ðŸš« ðŸ™… ðŸš« â†’ ${err.message}`);
});
```

We finally require `./app` which is our application and then we start the server

### Start the server
`$ npm start`

Look instead `package.json` and you see all the **scripts** and any time you type `npm` + one of the script names, you will execute the value on the write of the script key

So `$ npm start` will execute: 

`$ concurrently \"npm run watch\" \"npm run assets\" --names \"ðŸ’»,ðŸ“¦\" --prefix name`

**note** `$ npm start` will also call other scripts `watch` and `assets` and the will also execute **concurrently**

#### What all this means
* We kick off a node process and start on `./start.js` and we'll use a package call `nodemon` (monitors our files and any time there is a change to one of our JavaScript files, it will shut down and restart the server again)
* Then we run `assets`
    - This is just for our CSS and our client side JavaScript
    - Nothing to do with backend, just there to compile our Sass into CSS and compile our frontend JavaScript into a bundle.js for us

### After we run our server
* We'll see logs that come from our computer (coming from our node Application)
* And log that comes from box (logs that come from our webpack Application)
* We should our server is running on port `7777`

[http://localhost:7777/](http://localhost:7777/)

Will show us `Hey! It works!`
