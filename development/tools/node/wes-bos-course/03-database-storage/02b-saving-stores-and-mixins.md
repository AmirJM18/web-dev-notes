# Saving Stores and Mixins - Part B

### Remove the code we added to pass mixin data

`editStore.pug`

```
extends layout

include mixins/_storeForm

block content
  .inner
    h2= title
    +storeForm()
```

`_storeForm.pug`

```
mixin storeForm(store = {})
  p It works!
```

## Now let's add our real form we will be using
`_storeForm.pug`

```
mixin storeForm(store = {})
  form(action="/add" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data" class="card")
    label(for="name") Name 
    input(type="text" name="name")
```

### View in browser
Should look like this:

![form rendered](https://i.imgur.com/JtZBYk6.png)

* `-` In **Pug** using `-` at beginning of line means you are running JavaScript
* We show how you loop in Pug using **each** (_each choice in choices_)

`_storeForm.pug`

```
mixin storeForm(store = {})
  form(action="/add" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data" class="card")
    label(for="name") Name 
    input(type="text" name="name")
    label(for="description") Description
    input(type="text" name="description")
    - const choices = ['Wifi', 'Open Late', 'Family Friendly', 'Vegetarian', 'Licensed']
    ul.tags
      each choice in choices
        .tag.tag__choice
          input(type="checkbox" id=choice value=choice name="tags")
          label(for=choice) #{choice}
```

* Take note how some have quotations and some do not

`input(type="checkbox" id=choice value=choice name="tags")`

* The attributes who's values are not surrounded with quotations are using our `choice` variable as the value

### View in browser
Should look like this:

## Add a button, View, Fill out form
* We changed input to textreaa

`_storeForm.pug`

```
mixin storeForm(store = {})
  form(action="/add" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data" class="card")
    label(for="name") Name 
    input(type="text" name="name")
    label(for="description") Description
    textarea(name="description")
    - const choices = ['Wifi', 'Open Late', 'Family Friendly', 'Vegetarian', 'Licensed']
    ul.tags
      each choice in choices
        .tag.tag__choice
          input(type="checkbox" id=choice value=choice name="tags")
          label(for=choice) #{choice}
    input(type="submit" value="Save" class="button")
```

## Submit
We get a 404 error

![404](https://i.imgur.com/Og7qrCI.png)

### What went wrong?
When you submit a form we use the `method` and ours is **POST** (_method="POST"_) which is a way to send data that is not visible in the URL and **action** tells us where we are sending the **data** and we are sending ours to `/add`

* POST - sending data not through the URL
* GET - sending data through the URL (_Great for bookmarking a page_)

#### Refreshing POST
When you refresh a page that has been POSTED to the browser will ask you if you want to confirm the `Form Resubmission`

![form resubmission](https://i.imgur.com/J9wDZ8t.png)

* If you hit `Continue` you still get a **404**
* And if you refresh you get the same alert window and you can't get back to our form page and that is because we are in a POST value
* But click on `ADD` 

![add](https://i.imgur.com/6OVsjCj.png)

* And that will take us back to our form

## Good to know
* `action` - Tells the browser where to send the data
* `method` - Tells the browser how to send the data

### Change method to GET
`_storeForm.pug`

```
mixin storeForm(store = {})
  form(action="/add" method="GET" enctype="multipart/form-data" class="card")
// more code
```

* Fill out the form and submit and now your form entries get sent throught the URL like this: `http://localhost:7777/add?name=asdf&description=asdf&tags=Family+Friendly`

* That is great for bookmarking pages but we don't want that
* We want our data not sent through URL so we use `method="POST"`

## Posting
* Why were we getting our 404?
* Check out our current routes

`index.js`

```
// more code
router.get('/', storeController.homePage);
router.get('/add', storeController.addStore);
// more code
```

* We are using `router.get()` which means when we visit that page we are **getting** that page
* But we want to **post** to a page
    - Generally when
        + A form is submitted
        + Or posting to that using jQuery or Axios or any other library you may be using

`index.js`

```
// more code
router.get('/', storeController.homePage);
router.get('/add', storeController.addStore);
router.post('/add', storeController.createStore); // add this line
// more code
```

## Add our controller
* We want to just get the data that was sent to this page
* Change our method back to **"POST"**
* Add this new controller method

`storeController.js`

```
exports.homePage = (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.name);
  res.render('index');
};

exports.addStore = (req, res) => {
  res.render('editStore', { title: 'ðŸ’© Add Store' });
};

// add this new method
exports.createStore = (req, res) => {
  res.json(req.body);
};
```

## Fill out and submit form
### Empty Result?
We get an empty result set and that is because of this `enctype="multipart/form-data"` and since that is a special case (we are uploading images using our form) but for now remove it, fill out the form and submit

### Success!
here is our output

```
{
"name": "john",
"description": "test",
"tags": [
"Wifi",
"Family Friendly",
"Licensed"
]
}
```

And if you are using a JSON formatter for Chrome you'll see this:

![nice JSON](https://i.imgur.com/Z36ltAm.png)

```
exports.createStore = (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.body); // add this
  res.json(req.body);
};
```

Refill out the form and submit and check out the terminal

If your terminal is full just `cmd` + `k` to clear out terminal and you'll see:

## Next - How do we save that data back to the Database?
We'll use Mongoose and async-await to save the data to the Database
