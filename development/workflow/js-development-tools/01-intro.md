# JavaScript Development Tools

## Types of JS Dev Tools
* Coding Environments
* Command Line Tools
* Code Respositories
* Task Runners
* Compilers and Transpilers
* Error Linting and Debugging
* Testing Frameworks

### Coding Environments
Applications in which we write and edit our code. Let's break them down into two types: Code editors & IDEs

### Command Line Tools
Run scripts and tools from a command prompt. Stand-alone & in code editors

### Code Repositories
Places where you can push and pull code from, often version controlled.

### Task Runners
Manages other tools based on a configuration file and command line prompts.

### Compilers
Modify source files. (i.e. contatenate, format, minify...)

### Transpilers
Rewrite newer JavaScript features in ways supported in current devices.

### Error Linting
Catches misspelled words, missing punctuation, syntax errors, etc.

### Debugging
One step further than Error Linting, and let's you walk through your code step-by-step or stop at certain points to find problems.

### Testing Frameworks
Let us write checks to make sure our code runs as expected. Unit testing, TDD (Test Driven Development), BDD (Behavioral Driven Development)
