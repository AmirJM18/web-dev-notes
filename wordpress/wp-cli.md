# WP CLI

WP-CLI enables you to update WordPress from the terminal. It is a great improvement in the traditional way to update WordPress.

## Core Update

```
$ wp core update
$ wp core update-db
```

## Deactivate all plugins at one time

```
$ wp plugin deactivate --all
```

## Back up DB

[helpful link](https://blog.sucuri.net/2015/07/wp-cli-guide-secure-wordpress-backup-update.html)

```
$ wp db export
```

### Update all plugins 

```
wp plugin update --all
```

### Update all themes

```
wp theme update --all
```

## Create list of current plugins or themes

```
$ wp plugin list
$ wp theme list
```

## Sample ways to modify plugins

```
$ wp plugin install akismet
$ wp plugin activate akismet
$ wp plugin update akismet
$ wp plugin deactivate zeroday
$ wp plugin delete zeroday
```

## Sample ways to modify themes

```
$ wp theme install twentyfifteen
$ wp theme activate twentyfifteen
$ wp theme update twentyfifteen
$ wp theme disable twentyfifteen
$ wp theme delete twentyfifteen
```

## How to install WP-CLI

```
# cd public_html
# curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wp-cli/builds/gh-pages/phar/wp-cli.phar
```

Check if WP-CLI works

```
$ php wp-cli.phar --info
```

### WP command
We want to just have to type `wp` as the command instead of `php wp-cli.phar` so in order to accomplish this, do this:

```
$ chmod +x wp-cli.phar
$ sudo mv wp-cli.phar /usr/local/bin/wp
```

Now if you type the following:

```
$ wp --info
```

Output will look something like below:

Make sure you are in the correct folder. The correct folder will be where you want to install WordPress.

If you are using MAMP and set up `Sites` as your Document Root. the path would be

```
$ cd ~/Sites/my-wordpress-project
```

or if you are on a remote box, the path might be...

```
$ cd /var/www/wp-project
```

### Core download install

This will grab all the current WordPress files from the github WordPress repo, extract them and put them inside your site project folder. This is a huge time saver as it can install WordPress in seconds (with a fast internet connection)

```
$ wp core download
```

### Create the wp-config.php file

If you were manually installing WordPress through the browser you would be brought to a page where you put in your database connection information. This would in turn create your `wp_config.php` file. WP-CLI speeds this step up with a little terminal magic.

Before you do this step you need to create a database in MySQL. Using the GUI phpMyAdmin is the way most people do this. You can also use the Terminal, sign into MySQL and create a database this way. As you use the terminal more and more the second option may become your first choice.

So now you are ready to create your `wp-config.php` file

```
$ wp core config --dbuser=root --dbpass=root --dbname=wp_bootstrap
```

This will create the file to connect you to your MySQL databse. The above code is assuming you used MAMP and the default username and password for MAMP is root and root. Change the --dbname value to match the name you used when creating the empty database in phpMyAdmin (or MySQL terminal). I recommend using underscores instead of dashes in db names with more than one word (ie my_db instead of my-db). For security reasons you may want to not have db in name so hackers won't find it so easily.

### Finishing Up Core Install

If you were manually installing WordPress through the browser you would be brought to a page asking you for your username and password, title of the page, email and URL of your WordPress site (local, staging or production depending on the environment you are working in). WP-CLI speeds this step up with the magic of the terminal. 

```
$  wp core install --url=http://localhost/test-wp-site --title=WPTest --admin_user=peh2 --admin_password=password --admin_email=howley.phil@gmail.com
```

* sometimes you may have to rename localhost in wp-config.php to 127.0.0.1 to avoid database connection error

If you get the above error try to change the file permissions:

```
$ chmod 644 wp-config.php
```

* If you get success, wordpress has been installed on command line. 
* Log in with the credentials you just created.

**IMPORTANT:** Manually Check `Discourage search engines from indexing this site`

Where to get name for theme/plugin?

If you want to install a new plugin but you donâ€™t know the slug for it, you can find it as a directory under [WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org)

Of course, take care to only install plugins and themes from trusted sources because pirated and nulled themes and plugins are dangerous and often contain some nasty backdoors.

### Problems with MAMP and WP-CLI
* Check out [mamp.md](https://github.com/kingluddite/web_dev_notes/blob/master/workflow/development/mamp.md)

This is a common error. I've run into a bunch of different ones and spend more time then I would have liked to troubleshoot and resolve them. The main error has to do with something like `database connection`. MAMP is usually the problem. I think because I moved from MAMP to virtual box, vagrant, vvv I ran into problems because I first started with MAMP and set my .zshrc to be working with MAMP and then when I moved to virtualbox and went back and forth between MAMP and virtual box, I think I just had to update my .zshrc with the correct info. Just make sure whatever you are using the PHP and MySQL are pointing to the right place.

add this to your `.zshrc` file

**note** I use oh-my-zsh instead of bash. Lots of developers love oh-my-zsh and so I moved from bash to the zsh. I highly recommend Wes Bos 10 free videos on getting up and running with zsh.

`.zshrc`

* make sure your php version is the correct folder

```
##
# WP-CLI / MAMP compat
##
export MAMP_PHP=/Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php5.5.10/bin
export PATH="$MAMP_PHP:$PATH:/Applications/MAMP/Library/bin"
```

**IMPORTANT:** Remember to refresh bash or zshr with:
```
$ source ~/.bash_profile
# or
$ source ~/.zshrc
```

## WP-CLI

I wanted to get WP-CLI working on GoDaddy so this article helped me set that up.
