# What is NoSQL?

MySQL, PostgreSQL and MongoDB - all are databases, they still request a database server to be started up, you have to connect to it to issue commands to Create, Read, Update or Delete (_CRUD_)

That is where things are similar between NoSQL and Relational Databases

* How the data is stored is drastically different
* SQL databases have a "predefined" table with various columns and all the records have a value for that column
    - Collection of data called **table**
    - individual item is called **Row/Record**
    - `name` column for this Record
* NoSQL is way different
    - We work with a "collection" of documents (aka Collection)
    - Individual record referred to as a **Document**
    - `name` field for this Document
