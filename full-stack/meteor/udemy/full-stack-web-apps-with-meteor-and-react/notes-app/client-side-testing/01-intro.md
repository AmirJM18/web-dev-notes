# Intro to Client-side Testing
## Enzyme Library
* Open source library
* Released by airbnb
* Enzyme lets you render your Components, passing in various values, and it lets you do things like simulate **click events**, **state changes** and **prop changes**
    - You can then make assertions that assert the Component responded correctly
