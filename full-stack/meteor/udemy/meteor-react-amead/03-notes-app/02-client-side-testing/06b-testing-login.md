# More Testing Login
## Learn new techniques
* How to set form data from our tests   
    - We'll be able to set a value for email and password
    - Simulate a form submit
    - Make sure our `prop` **loginWithPassword()** was called with the correct form data

## Add two PENDING test cases
`it('should call loginWithPassword with the form data');`

`it('should call loginWithPassword callback errors');`
